## Purpose and Learning Objectives

The primary purpose of cloning the website was to gain hands-on experience in web development. By studying an existing
website and attempting to recreate it, I aimed to achieve the following learning objectives:

1. **HTML and CSS Proficiency:** Deepen my understanding of HTML and CSS by analyzing and replicating the website's
   layout, structure, and styling.

2. **Navigation and Interactivity:** Implement navigation menus, buttons, and other interactive elements to replicate
   user interactions.

3. **Image and Media Handling:** Learn how to optimize and display images and other media elements effectively.

4. **GitHub Version Control:** Use Git and GitHub for version control to track changes and manage the project.

## Process

1. **Website Analysis:** Carefully study the original website's layout, structure, colors, typography, and other design
   elements.

2. **HTML and CSS:** Create HTML markup and CSS styles to replicate the visual appearance of the original website.

3. **Responsive Design:** Implement responsive design techniques using media queries and flexible layout approaches.

4. **GitHub Repository:** Set up a GitHub repository to track changes, collaborate, and maintain the project.

## Challenges Faced

While cloning the website, I encountered several challenges:

- Ensuring cross-browser compatibility.
- Fine-tuning responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Understanding and adapting specific design patterns.

## Conclusion

Cloning this website was an enriching learning experience that allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge into practical
web development skills. By recreating the website, I developed a better understanding of HTML, CSS, responsive design,
and version control using GitHub.
